This project was mainly concentrated on extracting all the information about a patent, which includes several fields such as, Patent Number, Filed Date, Abstract, 
Citied Patent number and so on. This process was carried out for about 1 million patent numbers. The goal of the project was to find out connected components
using company names, which will be carried out in future.

Prerequisites
This section tells you about what softwares, what IDE and on what platform did we run the project.
To extract all the patent information from webpage and to convert those webpage into a notepad file delimited by '@', Python 2.7/Python 3.6 were used.
This project also requires you to install Rstudio, in order to find out connected component.

Download R and Rstudio for windows
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/

Download R and Rstudio for Mac OS
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/

Python can be ran on IDE like Visual Studio 2015, Anaconda
One can find both Python 3.6 and Python 2.7 for both Mac OS and Windows here https://www.python.org/downloads/

Implementation.
First a list containing all patent numbers is copied onto a notepad, upon running the code, the code copies patent numbers and feeds one patent number at a time to 
URL, which is directed to USPTO website. The result of this program will be a webpage which is stored in user specified location.

Next these webpages are further used by another program, required fields for the further execution are extracted from the webpage and are copied onto a notepad,
the fields are delimited by '@'

To obtain the final result, that is to have a CSV file. The contents in notepad are copied onto a CSV file and seperated into columns delimited by '@'.

This happens to be a 3 step process. In future all these three steps can be merged into one, that is when a patent number is fed into a URL, it automatically 
obtains the webpage and converts that webpage into CSV and using the data present in CSV and a R code, connected components will be obatined.
